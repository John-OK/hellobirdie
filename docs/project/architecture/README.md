# HelloBirdie Architecture Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the overall system architecture and design decisions.

## Contents

- [system-overview.md](./system-overview.md) - Overview of the system architecture and components

## Architecture Principles

The HelloBirdie architecture follows these key principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Clear boundaries between frontend and backend
   - Modular component design

2. **API-First Design**
   - Well-defined API contracts
   - Backend and frontend can evolve independently

3. **Mobile-First Approach**
   - Responsive design from the ground up
   - Performance optimization for mobile devices

4. **Security by Design**
   - Environment variables for secrets
   - Input validation on all user data
   - API rate limiting
   - CORS configuration

5. **Scalability**
   - Stateless backend design
   - Caching strategies
   - Database optimization

## Technology Selection Rationale

The technology stack was selected based on:

- Team expertise
- Community support
- Long-term maintenance
- Performance characteristics
- Security considerations

See the [system overview](./system-overview.md) for more details on specific components.
