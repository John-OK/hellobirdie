## Development Philosophy

HelloBirdie follows these core principles:

1. **Test-Driven Development** - We write tests before implementation
2. **PostgreSQL for all environments** - Consistent database across development, testing, and production
3. **Hybrid development approach** - Local-first development and testing, with Docker-based verification
4. **Mobile-first design** - All features are designed for mobile compatibility first

## Need Help?
